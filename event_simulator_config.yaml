# Event Simulator Configuration
# Configure realistic event generation with probabilistic behavior

simulation:
  # Number of concurrent users to simulate
  num_users: 10
  
  # Duration of simulation in seconds (0 = run indefinitely)
  duration_seconds: 300  # 5 minutes
  
  # Base interval between events per user (seconds)
  base_interval: 2.0
  
  # Add randomness to intervals (± percentage)
  interval_variance: 0.5  # 50% variance
  
  # API endpoint configuration
  # - Use http://localhost:8000 when running from the host machine
  # - Use http://backend:8000 when running inside the Docker network
  api_url: "http://localhost:8000/api/events"
  
  # Request timeout in seconds
  timeout: 5

# User behavior configuration

# Event probabilities (must sum to 1.0 for each category)
# These determine the relative frequency of each event type

event_probabilities:
  # Session events (rare)
  session_start: 0.05      # 5% - User starts a session
  session_end: 0.05        # 5% - User ends a session
  
  # Page events (medium frequency)
  page_visit: 0.25         # 25% - User visits a page
  page_close: 0.20         # 20% - User closes/leaves a page
  
  # Interaction events (high frequency)
  button_click: 0.40       # 40% - User clicks a button
  link_click: 0.05         # 5% - User clicks a link
